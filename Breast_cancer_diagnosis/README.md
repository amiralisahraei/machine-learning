# Breast Cancer diagnosis

In this project, we aim to classify two types of breast tumors including:
#### Bengin
####  Malignant

### 
Futhermore, the result of the project is comparing the evelaution measures in a few tpyes of algorthms including:

- SVM
- Logistic regreesion
- kNN
- Decision Tree
- XGBoost
- Neural Network

# Result
In conclusion, KNN model outperformed it's counterparts in Accuracy, Precision, and F1, but XGBoost model excelled compared to the others in Recall


## Run The Project

To run the project, run the following command

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
then
```bash
  python app.py
```
